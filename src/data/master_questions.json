      "C": "Business analysis.",

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "A comprehensive TCO analysis comparing on-premises to AWS must include the cost of physical hardware (servers, networking, storage) that must be purchased on-premises but is replaced by AWS's managed infrastructure. Application development and business analysis costs remain relatively constant regardless of where you host, and market research is not a TCO component.",
